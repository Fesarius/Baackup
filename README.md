# Baackup
A backup script for our Minecraft server, sponsored by sheep

<sub>It's sponsored by sheep because it's called **baa**ckup :wink:</sub>


##How 2 use l√® baackup script

1. Either clone the repo to your client, download the zip, or donwload the latest release if stability is your thing
2. Add the script to the root folder of your server (the one with your JAR file and such)
3. If you use Essentials, you can add the name of the bat file (extension included) to your Essentials config.yml file as the ```backup-script``` config value and then set the interval, otherwise, just set it up to run automatically using Task Scheduler or something.
5. ***will be continued later***
